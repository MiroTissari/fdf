# fdf
The first project of the graphic branch in The Hive.(I ended up doing another branch)
  
![fdf hive gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90178358/209221714-2c1f60da-6789-4fee-8b1c-e0b4fcf8ba7b.gif)
  

## What is it about?
The objective of the project is to get somekind of an understanding how graphics work.  
The idea is to make a program that displays on screen a given map in at least 2 different projections, and I chose isometric and parallel projections.  
The maps would have x-, y- and z-coordinates, of which the 'z' is the elevation.  
We were provided with a small graphic library called minilibx, which allowes us to present pixels on screen.  
  
## How to Use
  
At the root of the repository, type ```make``` to compile the program.  
Check from the maps-directory which map you want to use and type **./fdf maps/map_name.fdf** ie. ```./fdf maps/hive.fdf```  
When the window pops up, hold down the left button of your mouse to display instructions.
