# fdf
The first project of the graphic branch in The Hive.

## What is it about?
The objective of the project is to get somekind of an understanding how graphics work.
The idea is to make a program that displays on screen a given map in at least 2 different projections, and I chose isometric and parallel projections. The maps would have x-, y- and z-coordinates, of which the 'z' is the elevation.
We were provided with a small graphic library called minilibx, which allowes us to present pixels on screen.

## How to Use
```
type **make** to compile the program.
check from the maps-directory which map you want to use and type **./fdf maps/map_name.fdf** ie. *./fdf maps/hive.fdf*
When the window pops up, hold the left button of your mouse to display instructions.
```
